# BowdoinHackathon
A Pygame project completed in 7 hours for Bowdoin's Supreme Gaming Hackathon, winning the Bates team 3rd place. Sprite sheets and art were created by Abdullah in Gimp. Sprite groups, enemies, event handling, and player behavior were coded by Michael. Game infrastructure, collision detection, and hero class were coded by Tucker. Implementation and level design was a joint effort between Tucker and Michael. The concept was brainstormed by the entire team, inspired by classic top-down bullet hell flash games.

Running "run.py" will start the games

We ran out of time before being able to complete the enemy aiming system, add a UI, and balance player HP and the number of "bullets" on screen. Therefore, the player is invulnerable, but snowmen are destructable. The snowmen and trees are procedurally generated as well.
